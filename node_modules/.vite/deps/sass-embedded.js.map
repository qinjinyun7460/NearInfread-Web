For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n *\n *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n *\n * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n *\n * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n *\n * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n * if it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n *\n *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n *\n * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n *\n * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n *\n *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n *     }\n *\n * All Immutable collections are Value Objects: they implement `equals()`\n * and `hashCode()`.\n */\nfunction is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n        valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n        valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n        if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n            return true;\n        }\n        if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return !!(isValueObject(valueA) &&\n        isValueObject(valueB) &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB));\n}\n\nfunction update$1(collection, key, notSetValue, updater) {\n    return updateIn(\n    // @ts-expect-error Index signature for type string is missing in type V[]\n    collection, [key], notSetValue, updater);\n}\n\nfunction merge$1() {\n  var iters = [], len = arguments.length;\n  while ( len-- ) iters[ len ] = arguments[ len ];\n\n  return mergeIntoKeyedWith(this, iters);\n}\n\nfunction mergeWith$1(merger) {\n  var iters = [], len = arguments.length - 1;\n  while ( len-- > 0 ) iters[ len ] = arguments[ len + 1 ];\n\n  if (typeof merger !== 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError('Invalid merger function: ' + merger);\n  }\n  return mergeIntoKeyedWith(this, iters, merger);\n}\n\nfunction mergeIntoKeyedWith(collection, collections, merger) {\n  var iters = [];\n  for (var ii = 0; ii < collections.length; ii++) {\n    var collection$1 = KeyedCollection(collections[ii]);\n    if (collection$1.size !== 0) {\n      iters.push(collection$1);\n    }\n  }\n  if (iters.length === 0) {\n    return collection;\n  }\n  if (\n    collection.toSeq().size === 0 &&\n    !collection.__ownerID &&\n    iters.length === 1\n  ) {\n    return isRecord(collection)\n      ?
